Abstract: In this article, we address two gaps in NLP research: working with his- torical French and working with complex textual structures moving beyond running text or lists of place names. Our methodology is based on the evaluation of the results of two spatial named entity recognition tools in the context of early modern document analysis structured as dictionaries.
