Abstract: The [GeoDISCO project](www.msh-lse.fr/projet19/geodisco) aims at studying the major changes in encyclopedic geographical discourse in France between 1751 (when the first volume of the Encyclopédie ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, by Diderot and D’Alembert, was published) and today (Wikipedia-France, 2018). 
Using linguistic and GIS methods to investigate patterns in geographical content will help us understand why authors deployed language in such ways that use place as a scaffold for ideas and practices. The spatial history of French encyclopedias is a foundation for asking broader questions about the relationship between early modern geographical information and digital geographical resources.
