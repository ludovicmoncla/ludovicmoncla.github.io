Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for the reconstruction of itineraries extracted from narrative texts. This approach is divided into two main tasks. The first extracts geographical information with natural language processing. Its outputs are annotations of so called expanded entities and expressions of displacement or perception from hiking descriptions. In order to reconstruct a plausible footprint of an itinerary described in the text, the second task uses the outputs of the first task to compute a minimum spanning tree.
