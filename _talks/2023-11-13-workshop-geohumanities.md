<br/><br/>
Following the success of previous editions, this workshop concerns with the use of geographic information systems and other spatial technologies in humanities research, placing an emphasis on new methodologies that leverage the aforementioned technical developments. The standard tools from geographic information systems, as well as more advanced methods such as text- and image-based geographical analysis or spatial simulation, can all benefit from innovative approaches leveraging machine learning, parallel and/or distributed computation, semantic technologies, etc. on humanities sources like archival manuscripts, maps, encyclopedias, newspapers, correspondence collections and more. These kinds of documents pose new challenges for identifying and analyzing spatial information. The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from different sub-fields of computer science and the geographical information sciences interested in the application of spatial methods and technology to the humanities to discuss how to address these issues in ways that generate new knowledge in multiple disciplines. Participants will demonstrate their contributions and explore how modern GIS and other technologies can inform, and be inspired by, the digital humanities.
