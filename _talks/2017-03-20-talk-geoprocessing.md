Abstract: The textual geographical information is frequently or- ganized around spatial named entities. Such entities have intrinsic ambiguities and Named Entity Recognition and Classification methods should be improved in order to handle this problem. This article describes a knowledge-based method implementing a full process with the aim of annotating in a more precise way the spatial information in the textual documents. This gain in accuracy guarantees a better analysis of the spatial information and a better disambiguation of places. The backbone of our proposal is a construction grammar and a cascaded finite-state transducers. The evaluation shows that the introduced concept of hierarchical overlapping, is very helpful to detect a local context associated with Named Entities.
