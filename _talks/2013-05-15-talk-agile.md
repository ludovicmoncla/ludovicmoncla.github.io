Abstract: The aim of this work is to find sub-types for Place Named Entities, from the analysis of relations between Place Names and a nominal group within a specific phrasal context. The proposed method combines the use of specific intra-sentential lexico-syntactic relations and external resources like gazetteers, thesauri, or ontologies. It relies on expanded spatial named entities recognition transcribed into a symbolic representation expressed in terms of semantic features. This symbolic representation will then be associated with a geo-coded representation, depending on the available resources. Our method is completely implemented and has been tested on a corpus of travelogues.
