Abstract: This paper introduces the Perdido Python library for geoparsing and geocoding French texts. The architecture of the Perdido Geoparser, which includes three layers: back-office, API, and Python library, is outlined. We also provide details on the methods used in the development of the processing chain and the various tasks covered, such as named entity recognition and classification (NERC), and toponym resolution. Lastly, we showcase the different features of the Python library and explain how to use it. The library is built as an overlay using API services, enabling users to manipulate, visualize, and export the results of geoparsing and geocoding. A [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ludovicmoncla/perdido/blob/main/notebooks/perdido-geoparser-GeoExT-ECIR23.ipynb) is also provided to demonstrate all the functionalities implemented in the library.
