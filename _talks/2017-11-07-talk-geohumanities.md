Abstract: Our project involves building a platform able to retrieve, map and analyze the occurrences of place names in fictional novels published between 1800 and 1914 and whose action occurs wholly or partly in Paris. We describe a proof of concept using queries made via the TXM textual analysis platform for the extraction of street names. Then, we propose a fully automatic process using the named entity recognition (NER) components of the PERDIDO platform. This paper describes some encouraging initial results obtained by combining NLP approaches (NER methods) with textometric tools for the automated geoparsing of street names.
